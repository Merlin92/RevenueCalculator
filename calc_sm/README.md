### Task: Stadium Seating ###

There are three seating categories at an athletic stadium. For a football game:

Class A seats cost €16 each
Class B seats cost €11 each
Class C seats cost €8 each

Create an application that allows the user to enter the number of tickets sold for each class.

The application should be able to display the amount of income generated from each class of ticket sales and the total revenue generated.

Change the Font properties of the labels to the font and size of your choice.

Follow good programming conventions for object names: include remarks at the top of every method and at the top of the file.
Give the stadium a name and display at the top of the form.
Use GroupBox controls for “Tickets Sold” & “Revenue Generated”.

Assign access keys to each button.

Include code to handle invalid inputs errors

Use currency formatting to display the results in euros.

Include your name in the bottom right corner “Programmed by ................”
